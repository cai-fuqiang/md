EC == 0b100101
Data Abort taken without a change in Exception level.
Used for MMU faults generated by data accesses, alignment faults other than those
caused by Stack Pointer misalignment, and synchronous External aborts, including
synchronous parity or ECC errors. Not used for debug-related exceptions.
See ISS encoding for an exception from a Data Abort.
